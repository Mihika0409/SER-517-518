The entire code along with the refined data ( CSV Files) can be found on the github. 
The link to the repository is : https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517

The repository has 2 branches Correlation and Analyzing which contains the code and the data.

Our scrum excel sheet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW7p3KsIhmvBnJWCXY2cfZI2kdoLTMZQTkdOa7Axf1U/edit?usp=sharing 

	For running the prototype:
	
	Correlation: 
	The Link to the Branch can be found here: 
	https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Correlation

We need to make sure we are in the Correlation Branch, The Branch contains separate directories for each of the team members including their respective data and code files.

For running the code download or clone any directory, for instance https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Correlation/Vibhuti , 
the directory has further code and data directories.

The Project_CorelationFiles.py has the code and is executable, Please make sure the path for the csv specified is correct in the python. It might be different for every local machine.


Analyzing:
