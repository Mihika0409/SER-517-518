# SER-517
Codes for analyzing the dataset

# Setup
Python 2.7

## The following Python libraries need to be installed prior to running the code:
 (install with pip)
	Pandas
	Sklearn.preprocessing
	Math	
	Matplotlib.plot
	Numpy
	Seaborn
	Scipy

## Download ntlk packages
	In the python terminal, run the following commands to download ntlk.corpus:
	import nltk
	nltk.download() or nltk.download_shell() if the console hangs on 'showing info'

	from the download ui, type d to download. When prompted for a package identifier, type the package: all-corpora

The entire code along with the refined data ( CSV Files) can be found on the github. 
The link to the repository is : https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517

The repository has 2 branches Correlation and Analyzing which contains the code and the data.

Our scrum excel sheet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW7p3KsIhmvBnJWCXY2cfZI2kdoLTMZQTkdOa7Axf1U/edit?usp=sharing 

	For running the prototype:
	
	Correlation: 
	The Link to the Branch can be found here: 
	https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Correlation

We need to make sure we are in the Correlation Branch, The Branch contains separate directories for each of the team members including their respective data and code files.

For running the code download or clone any directory, for instance https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Correlation/Vibhuti , 
the directory has further code and data directories.

The Project_CorelationFiles.py has the code and is executable, Please make sure the path for the csv specified is correct in the python. It might be different for every local machine.


Analyzing:
The Link to the Branch can be found here: https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Analyzing

We need to make sure we are in the Analyzing Branch, The Branch contains separate directories for each of the team members including their respective data and code files.

For running the code download or clone any directory, for instance https://github.com/Mihika0409/SER-517/tree/Analyzing/Mihika
the directory has further code and data directories.

The injury_comments_analysis.py has the code and is executable, Please make sure the path for the csv specified is correct in the python. It might be different for every local machine.
